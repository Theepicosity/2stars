# 2stars
A star-themed Terraria modpack!

2Stars is a modpack with 30 mods, including The Stars Above and Starlight River. It aims to provide a unique and cohesive experience by including smaller content mods alongside larger ones, and including several mods that improve the world generation and general ambience.

Part of that unique and cohesive experience is the 2Stars Compatability Mod. This is a WIP mod that enables cross-mod content, balance changes, and general compatability. This mod is not available yet, so if the modpack loader tries to find it and throws an error, just ignore it.

This modpack is in it's very early stages of being developed, so please check back frequently for any updates! If you have any issues or comments, please raise them in the issues tracker of this repository.
